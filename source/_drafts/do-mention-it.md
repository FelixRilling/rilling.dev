Some time ago I stumbled over [a blog post by Christine Dodrill](https://christine.website/blog/webmention-support-2020-12-02) which mentions (no pun intended) '[Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)'. Webmention is a technology that allows websites to send events when mentioning other sites, as well as receiving a notification when one's site is mentioned somewhere else.

Intrigued by this technology that I had not heard of before, I dug a bit deeper.
When implemented, Webmention can work like a very simple but privacy friendly analytics tool to find out where visitors might come from (e.g., if there is a notable increase in visitors after another blog mentions mine) which I find fascinating.
It can also enable you to showcase "other blogs that linked to this post"-like elements on your blog posts which could lead readers to related posts.
