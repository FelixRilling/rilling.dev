Some time ago I stumbled over [a blog post by Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/blog/webmention-support-2020-12-02) which mentions (pun intended) '[Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/)'. Webmention is a technology that allows websites to send notifications when they mention another site, as well as receiving a notification when one's site is mentioned from somewhere else.

When implemented, Webmention can work like a primitive but privacy friendly analytics tool to find out where visitors might come from (e.g., if there is a notable increase in visitors after another blog mentions yours).
It can also enable you to showcase "other blogs that linked to this post"-like elements on your blog posts, which could suggest related posts to your readers.

## How It Works

Webmention consists of two parts: The sending part, where a client notifies another website that they were mentioned, and the the receiving part, where a webserver takes HTTP requests from clients that send Webmentions to it. The website that does mention another is referred to as the _"source"_, while the website being mentioned is the _"target"_.

### Sending Webmentions

The following is an example of [steps taken](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/#webmention-protocol) when sending a Webmention, with the source website being this one (`https://rilling.dev/blog/an-introduction-to-webmention/`), and the target website being Xe's blog post `https://xeiaso.net/blog/webmention-support-2020-12-02`.

#### 1. Create a Website That Mentions Another One

This is done by having an [`<a>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) with a [`href` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-href) that links to the other website. In the case of this blog post, the link to Xe's blog post would be a mention of Xe's website:

```html
<a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/webmention-support-2020-12-02">
	a blog post by Xe Iaso
</a>
```

Other possible kinds of links include media links, such as the [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img), [`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) tags with the corresponding [`src` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-src). Non-HTML sources can also mention other websites, for example [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) or plain text documents. In these cases, any value that looks like an URL is treated as a mention.

#### 2. Find the Location of the Target Websiteâ€™s Webmention Endpoint

In order to be able to receive Webmentions, the target website has to advertise their Webmention endpoint. This is either done via a HTML [`<link>` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) with the [`rel` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#rel) set to `webmention`:

```html
<link href="https://mi.within.website/api/webmention/accept" rel="webmention" />
```

or by having the [`Link` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link) in the response:

```http
Link: <https://mi.within.website/api/webmention/accept>; rel="webmention"
```

Note: If the response of the target website does not include either, Webmentions cannot be sent to this website because no Webmention endpoint exists.

In this example, the Webmention endpoint was discovered to be `https://mi.within.website/api/webmention/accept`.

#### 3. Send the Webmention

Now that we have the endpoint, we send a POST request with two `x-www-form-urlencoded` parameters: the source and the target URL.

```http
POST https://mi.within.website/api/webmention/accept HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

source=https://rilling.dev/blog/an-introduction-to-webmention/&
target=https://xeiaso.net/blog/webmention-support-2020-12-02
```

If everything worked, the server will respond with a 2xx status code.
Depending on how the Webmention endpoint is set up, our Webmention could be rendered in the mentioned website, or simply logged away to a database somewhere.

### Receiving Webmentions

#### 1. Listen for Webmentions
